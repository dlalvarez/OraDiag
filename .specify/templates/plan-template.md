# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit-plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]

**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

The plan MUST explicitly answer each OraDiag constitutional gate:

- **RCA scope**: Confirms the feature investigates Oracle incidents and does
  not become health check, capacity planning, functional audit, business-data
  exploration or a generic anomaly finder.
- **Roadmap phase**: Identifies the exact roadmap phase/spec grouping and
  confirms no future phase is implemented early.
- **Evidence**: Defines required positive evidence, negative evidence and
  explicit limitations before any diagnosis or recommendation.
- **Symptom handling**: Treats reported symptoms as prioritization context, not
  as causal truth.
- **Causal roles**: Preserves `primary_cause`, `contributing_factor`,
  `related_finding`, `incidental_finding`, `ruled_out`, `not_evaluated` and
  `unknown`.
- **Visible OK reviews**: Explains which OK results must remain visible because
  they rule out hypotheses or affect confidence.
- **Causal domains**: Uses only the approved domains and treats Datos as a
  boundary, not permission to inspect business data.
- **No business tables**: Confirms no business tables, functional data or
  application-data meaning are queried, modeled or inferred.
- **Failures and timeouts**: Converts errors, timeouts, missing permissions and
  unavailable layers into limitations or non-evaluated reviews.
- **Security**: Uses minimum technical privileges and protects secrets in
  configuration, logs and reports.
- **Recommendations**: Requires scope, risk, prerequisites and human validation
  for risky, destructive, irreversible or production actions.
- **Evidence contract**: Keeps the formal Evidence Payload JSON-serializable,
  versioned and validated; YAML may only describe human lab scenarios.
- **Tests**: Defines automated tests for evidence, causal separation, OK
  reviews, limitations, symptom handling, no business data and JSON stability
  where applicable.
- **Language**: Keeps human documentation, reports and principal messages in
  Spanish.
- **Deviations**: Marks anything outside the constitution, active spec, approved
  plan or roadmap as `propuesta de desviación` requiring human authorization.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
